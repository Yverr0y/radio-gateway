"""Compare the Python packages requirements.txt declares against the ones
scripts/install.sh actually installs, and report drift.

Why this exists: install.sh does NOT read requirements.txt. It installs each
package explicitly, because several need special handling that a flat
`pip install -r` would get wrong — silero-vad and pyrnnoise are installed
--no-deps (to skip torch and matplotlib), pymumble has a fallback chain of
PyPI names, kv4p-ht-python is an editable clone of a git repo, and protobuf
has to be re-pinned last (see the pin-repair block in install.sh). So the two
lists are maintained by hand and can silently diverge.

They have diverged twice, both times the same way — a package the code
imports was missing from the installer, and the failure was invisible:
  * faster-whisper: every whisper/* model in the UI failed to load, including
    the starred recommendation.
  * prometheus-client: metrics.py's import is inside try/except at every call
    site, so instrumentation silently no-ops and /metrics returns 500 while
    install.sh cheerfully provisions Prometheus and a Grafana dashboard.

Exit status: 0 = no drift, 1 = drift found. Run it after touching either file.
